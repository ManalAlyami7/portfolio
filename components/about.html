            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Hello! I'm Manal Alyami, an Information Technology graduate from King Saud University with a passion for creating meaningful digital experiences through the intersection of user-centered design and artificial intelligence.</p>
                
                <p>My unique value proposition lies in my ability to combine technical expertise with human-centered thinking. While I'm technically proficient in AI/ML, data science, and full-stack development, what truly sets me apart is my focus on UX - ensuring that powerful technologies serve real human needs with intuitive, accessible interfaces.</p>
                
                <p>With a proven track record of developing award-winning projects like the Smart Hajj AI System (1st place at GenAI Bootcamp) and Rehaab (published at IEEE ICOCO 2024), I bring both technical depth and user empathy to every project. My academic excellence (4.69/5 GPA) reflects my commitment to quality and continuous learning.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I'm focused on advancing my expertise in generative AI systems and exploring opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects that improve lives through thoughtful technology implementation.</p>
