She distinguished herself for her confidence in linear algebra and calculus, skills needed for understanding of neural network architectures. In addition to a firm grasp of theoretical foundations, from matrix multiplications to agents, she has also showed exceptional product development skills. With her team she quickly developed and deployed a fully functional chatbot for a specific use case, with clean interface and intuitive use, which has been awarded with the first place in the batch. I would recommend Manal for any product development or research job in Data Science and AI."</p>

                        <p class="full-text hidden">"Manal had to be one of my most pleasant students during the Generative AI bootcamp while I was in Riyadh teaching the Fall/Winter cohort in 2025. Among one of the quieter students at the beginning of the bootcamp, but easily the most prepared. When we would be doing topics around software development and portfolio creation, she had already been ahead of her peers with great git practices and portfolio creation. No different from her portfolio was her preparation for class as it was rare to see her absent from a single class unless it was absolutely urgent. Manal was among the most consistent students in the cohort with her attendance and how well she applied the subject matter we learned in class to real-life applications and projects. If we learned something new, she was quick to adapt it to a real-life problem to sharpen her skills. This happened in every concept from fine-tuning, LLM evaluation upto agentic RAG she could make quick prototypes in class. An impressive self-starter who had an outstanding set of skills where she often impressed me with every single check in. One of the most memorable performances with Manal was to see her final presentation with Smart Hajj, a very advanced application of several AI tools; from langgraphs to TTS and STT integrated applications. Manal's skills in presenting exponentially improved in a matter of weeks with every bit of feedback where she had EASILY one of the best presentations. From a quieter student at the beginning to one of the best presentations that captured the audience incredibly well, I was truly impressed with how Manal evolved so quickly. Any company that receives her application should quickly consider adding her to the team as someone who is technically proficient and a strong communicator for the technologies she has worked with. Congratulations on a job well done and I wish you the absolute best in your career."</p>
